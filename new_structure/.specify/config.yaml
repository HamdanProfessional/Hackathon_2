# Workflow Rules
workflow:
  spec_driven_development:
    - "Specification must exist before implementation"
    - "All code must be generated from specs"
    - "No manual code writing allowed"
    - "Refine spec if code generation is incorrect"

  agent_coordination:
    - "Use appropriate specialist agents for tasks"
    - "Document all agent interactions"
    - "Generate PHRs for significant work"
    - "Review agent outputs before acceptance"

  quality_assurance:
    - "All code must be reviewed"
    - "Tests must accompany all features"
    - "Performance must be validated"
    - "Security must be considered"
