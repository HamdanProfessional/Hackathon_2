# Specification Quality Checklist: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Specification ready for `/sp.plan`

**Details**:
- All 16 checklist items passed
- 6 user stories with clear priorities and independent test scenarios
- 32 functional requirements organized by category
- 12 measurable success criteria (technology-agnostic)
- Edge cases identified and documented
- Assumptions and out-of-scope items clearly defined
- No clarification markers present

## Notes

This specification is complete and ready to proceed to architecture planning phase. The spec maintains technology-agnostic language while providing sufficient detail for implementation planning.

**Next Step**: Run `/sp.plan` to generate implementation architecture
